Controlling a desktop Synth

Bought a desktop analog synth
Disappointed by the user interface, 8 knobs, 1000 parameters
Wanted to hook up a MIDI knobs box
How to get the current values onto the encoder LEDs?
Intermediary program needed


Adding an intermediary program

Write something in Java, or C++, or another general purpose language
Use a music programming environment like Puredata, CMusic or MaxMSP
Use JavaScript


Options for MIDI and JavaScript

In the browser, using an Applet to do the actual MIDI I/O, works well except for the browser part and MacOS issues
Using Rhino, should work as well, but all the Java bloat kind of puts me off, and the MacOS issues remain
Using Node and a native extension, way to go


Writing Node extensions

Enjoyable, modern C++
Documentation is scarce
Attach C++ functions to objects
Create JavaScript objects from C++
Attach hidden "this" pointer to objects
Access hidden "this" pointer in C++ functions


Accessing MIDI

MIDI API not standardized across platforms
Multimedia APIs galore - MME, DirectX, ALSA, CoreMIDI
portmidi to the rescue, for MacOS, Linux, Windows
C API, stable, tested, documented


Making it asynchronous

portmidi has private timer/callback system
This needs to be adapted to libev
libev documentation is hard to find
Used Boost mutex / semaphore to block in libev worker


Extending a native extension

Objects created by native code are just plain JS objects
Only the base functionality is implemented in C++ (open/send/receive/close)
All higher-level functionality is written in JavaScript and attached to the relevant prototypes
For performance reasons, more stuff might be implemented in C++


Node and real-time

Garbage collection can require arbitary time
Collection time depends on the number of objects created
Measured response time jitter below 20ms
Performance is good enough for control
portmidi latency compensation and playout queueing can be used for better output accuracy


Future plans

Performance improvements (maybe)
Implement sequencer
Binary distribution
Windows, Linux ports
