Tetra editor preset management

Subjects:

- Sound

  Set of base parameters (0-184) that defines a certain sound
  Subject of editing
  Can be loaded from database
  Database contains sounds as their prime subjects

- Program

  Set of two sounds stored as "Program" in the Tetra

- Combo

  Set of four sounds store as "Combo" in the Tetra


Notes:

In Combo and Multi mode, layer B of a program is ignored
In "Key Mode" "Stack", two voices are assigned to one program

When editing a sound, a destination can be established.  The
destination determines which sound in the synth is affected by the
change.  Destinations can be Program A/B or Combo 1-4.  Switching the
destination can be done at any time through the "status" box in the
web interface.

All controller operations affect the Tetra edit buffers.  Writing the
current edit buffer to a Program or Combo is an explicit operation on
the "Presets" page.


UI plan:
--------

Web interface:

- The currently edited sound slot must always be displayed
-- In Program mode, layer A and B can be edited
-- In Combo and Multi mode, each of the four voices can be edited
-- Changing currently edited sound slot must always be possible
-- Changing sound names requires switching to the "Presets" page
- A "changed" indicator must always be displayed
- Toggling between the edited and the original sound should be possible

- Database contains a library of sounds
- Sounds are stored as objects and are converted to binary/numeric form only when they're sent to the Tetra
- Combos and programs can be assembled from the sounds library by drag and drop

BCR2000 behavior:

- The standard pages of the BCR2000 controller affect the currently edited sound
- Controls on the BCR2000 user pages can be assigned to any slot (Program A/B, Combo 1-4)
